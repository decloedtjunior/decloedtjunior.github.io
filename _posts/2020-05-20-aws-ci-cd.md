Some notes about CI/CD while studing for AWS Developer Certification...

# Table of Contents

# AWS CICD - CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy

**Continuous integration** is a software development practice where members of a team use a version control system and frequently integrate their work to the same location, such as a master branch. Each change is built and verified to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Continuous integration is focused on automatically building and testing code, as compared to continuous delivery, which automates the entire software release process up to production.

**Continuous delivery** is a software development methodology where the release process is automated. Every software change is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. Before the final push to production, a person, an automated test, or a business rule decides when the final push should occur. Although every successful software change can be immediately released to production with continuous delivery, not all changes need to be released right away.

Products covered by the exam: 
 - CodeCommit
 - CodePipeline
 - CodeBuild
