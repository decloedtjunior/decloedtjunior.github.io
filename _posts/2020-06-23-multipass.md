Multipass is a mini-cloud on your workstation using native hypervisors of all the supported plaforms (Windows, macOS and Linux). Multipass provides a command line interface to launch, manage and generally fiddle about with instances of Linux. The downloading of a minty-fresh image takes a matter of seconds, and within minutes a VM can be up and running. Pass multipass a custom cloud-init definition and turn a generic Ubuntu image into a custom-configured server in seconds. Check it out...
