I'm an extremely talented solution engineer, passionate about technology, motivated by innovation, that loves to be always learning something new and solving complex challenges. 

Since 1997, I'm having a lot of fun designing, building and delivering a wide variety of large-scale highly-available mission-critical solutions.

I've deep technical knowledge with proven experience with application development, distributed computing and messaging systems, enterprise application integration, databases (SQL/NoSQL) and cloud computing. 

My mindset is oriented to an DevOps culture, agile principles and practices, continuous release/deployment processes automation and to the [Reactive Manifesto](/reactive-manifesto).
