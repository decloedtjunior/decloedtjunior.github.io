### Index

To remain competitive and excel in the market, organizations must accelerate:

delivery of goods and services to delight their customers;
engagement with the market to detect and understand customer demand;
anticipation of compliance and regulatory changes that impact their systems; and
response to potential risks such as security threats or changes in the economy.
At the heart of this acceleration is software. This is true of organizations in any industry vertical. Banks no longer deliver value by holding gold bars in vaults but by trading faster and more securely, and by discovering new channels and products to engage customers. 



Software and technology are key differentiators for organizations to deliver value to customers and stakeholders



Technology leaders need to deliver software quickly and reliably to win in the market. For many companies, this requires significant changes to the way we deliver software. The key to successful change is measuring and understanding the right things with a focus on capabilitiesâ€”not on maturity.





compared to low performers, the high performers have:

46 times more frequent code deployments
440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy
170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime
5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)


 We measured product delivery lead time as the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production, and asked survey respondents to choose from one of the following options:

less than one hour
less than one day
between one day and one week
between one week and one month
between one month and six months
more than six months
